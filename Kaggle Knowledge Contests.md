** "SCD" = See competition description, "-" = No suggestions present **
** TS = Time series analysis, C = Classification, CV = Computer Vision, R = Regression, O = Optimization, S = Simulation, DL = Deep Learning, G = Geospatial Analysis **

Gemini, Claude gave bullshit resources and suggestions. Perplexity gave nice google results and quality collection of problems.

### Guidelines for Kaggle Competitions

1. **Understand the Problem**: Read the competition description thoroughly to understand the problem and the evaluation metric.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the data and identify patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that might improve the model's performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models based on the problem type (classification, regression, etc.).
5. **Model Training**: Train your models using the training data.
6. **Validation**: Use cross-validation to validate your model's performance.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize your model's hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
8. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models to improve performance.
9. **Submission**: Make predictions on the test set and submit your results.
10. **Learn from Others**: Study the notebooks and discussions of top performers to learn new techniques.
